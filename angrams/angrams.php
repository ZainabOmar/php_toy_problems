<!--  Given a single input string, write a function that outputs an array of strings with every possible
 combination of letters.

 At first, don't worry about repeated (duplicate) strings.

 What time complexity is your solution?

 Extra credit: De-duplicate your return array without using uniq().

  example usage:
  angrams('abc');
  echo(anagrams); // [ 'abc', 'acb', 'bac', 'bca', 'cab', 'cba' ] -->
